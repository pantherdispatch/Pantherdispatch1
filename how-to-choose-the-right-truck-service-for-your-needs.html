                <div class="blog__desc">
                  <p>When you have the DIY motivation, energy, and time, renting a truck and moving can be your best option. A DIY move can give you a lot more freedom than hiring a full-time service, and it can also help you save more money. However, choosing the right moving truck size and service is critical in this process. You don't want to have a truck that has less space, so you're sitting in the garage with half your stuff that needs to be loaded. In such cases, instead of saving some bucks, it can cost you a huge amount, not to mention the hassle you'll have to face. </p>
                  <p>We have compiled a comprehensive guide for you to pick up the right truck for your needs. Choosing the right truck can help you save from such situations.</p>
                  <h5>How to Choose the Right Moving Truck Size for Your Needs?</h5>
                  <p>Many people ask, "How big of a moving truck do I need? Well, selecting the correct moving truck sizes depends on a lot of factors, like your number of belongings and how delicate, small, or bulky those belongings are. There are two recommended ways to measure the size of your cargo, i.e., cubic feet and bedroom count. </p>
                  <h5>Cubic feet</h5>
                  <p>Each item holds a specific size and has a particular space. The cubic feet method is an effective way to find the length of truck you'll be needing for the move. This method demands much time and effort but is reliable for measuring the size of your haul as well as the truck. In this method, you need to measure all the large items like appliances and mattresses.</p>
                  <p>To have a more precise idea, pack all the small things too. When you pack these items and measure them, you'll have an estimation of the space they'll take up in the truck. When you're done with all the measurements, combine them, and you'll get an estimate of the area you need in your vehicle for the cargo.</p>
                  <h5>Bedroom count</h5>
                  <p>Bedroom count is the most common technique used to estimate moving truck sizes. Many companies offer a box truck size chart to determine what type of truck will be able to move a home based on its bedroom count. This method can sometimes be helpful, but it gives very unclear estimations of the sizes. Bedroom count cannot be a standard as some bedrooms are big enough to fit two or even three bedrooms of possessions. Moreover, there are other rooms in houses too, like study or storage rooms, that are not included in the count.</p>

                  <h5>Online moving calculator</h5>
                  <p>An online moving calculator is the best way to calculate the moving truck sizes you'll need. A moving calculator is able to tell you the cubic space you need based on your furniture and other possessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>You'll need to know the details of the furniture, equipment, and other stuff you're moving. Once you are clear, simply put the specifics into the calculator, and you'll get a correct estimate of the truck you need. To be on the safer side, you can book a truck that has 10-15% more cubic space than your estimation to ensure you've enough room. </p>
                  <h4>Different Types of Moving Trucks</h4>
                  <p>Moving companies offer different types of moving trucks. These trucks slightly variate in internal dimensions. Even the difference of a few feet can be huge when it comes to storage. The most common type of vehicle that is used for moving purposes is a box truck, typically known as a moving truck. Box trucks in streets and in front of homes are a usual sight. However, other moving vehicles are also frequently used, including cargo trailers, cargo vans, portable storage containers, and pickup trucks. Here is an explanation of all these vehicles so you can select the best option that caters to your needs. </p>

                  <h5>Box truck</h5>
                  <p>Box trucks are undoubtedly a staple in the moving industry. Every single moving company has various box trucks available varying in size. Box truck lengths usually range from 10 to 25 feet. These trucks are the best choice for medium-sized moving as they're perfect for urban areas and are easier to drive.</p>

                  <p>Although they cost more than pickups and vans, they're still cheaper than professional moving services. Box trucks are an excellent choice if you have a larger apartment. However, if your house has over five bedrooms, you might want to hire professional moving companies. </p>
                  <h5>Small box trucks</h5>
                  <p>The smallest box truck length you can get ranges from 10 to 12 feet, which means a storage capacity of 380-450 cubic feet. This size is suitable for larger studio apartments as it offers more space than cargo vans or trailers. If you've furniture pieces like a queen size bed or dressers, they can fit in small-sized moving trucks. However, for bulky furniture items like couches or king-size beds, you should select medium or large moving trucks.</p>
                  <h5>Medium box trucks</h5>
                  <p>DMedium-sized moving trucks are typically 15 to 17 feet long and give 650-860 cubic feet of space. Out of all the moving truck sizes, this one is the most popular and frequently rented one. These trucks are most suitable for tiny homes or two-bedroom apartments. Large pieces of furniture and appliances can be accommodated in the size of this truck, making it perfect for your king-size beds.</p>
                  <h5>Large box trucks</h5>
                  <p>These moving trucks are the most common commercially available trucks. The size ranges from 20 to 26 feet in length which provides a storage capacity of 1700 cubic feet. These box monsters can weigh up to 7000 pounds. Large-sized moving trucks are used for big houses or three to five-bedroom apartments. They can accommodate bulky furniture items and jumbo appliances, so you don't have to worry about your possessions not fitting in. The only problem with these trucks is their gas mileage. Additionally, because of their size, these trucks require some driving skills to manage. </p>
                  <h5>Pickup trucks </h5>
                  <p>If you're looking for the cheapest moving vehicle options out there, this is the one! Pickup trucks are readily available for rent from almost all moving companies. These trucks are typically 10 to 12 feet long and have a storage capacity of around 350-450 cubic feet. A pickup truck is ideal for shifting a few pieces of furniture or a small cargo. </p>
                  <p>One thing that you should keep in mind while selecting pickup trucks as your moving vehicle is that they're not suitable for long distances. They're not covered, which means your cargo is not protected from the elements. Moreover, fast speeds or winds can blow any stuff that is not tied down properly. This can result in loss or damage to possessions. However, pickup trucks are great if you're moving inside the city.</p>
                  <h5>Cargo vans</h5>
                  <p>Cargo vans are the middle option between a cargo trailer and a pickup truck. They are usually nine and a half feet long and offer 250 cubic feet of storage. Cargo vans are suitable over any distance because of the added protection from the elements. They can be great options for hauling items and small pieces of furniture when you're moving into a small studio apartment. What makes cargo vans stand out is their outstanding mileage and driving ease.</p>
                  <h5>Cargo trailers</h5>
                  <p>Cargo trailers are yet another excellent option for small-scale moving. They're enclosed containers that attach to another vehicle's tow hitch. Cargo trailers can hold up to 142-400 cubic feet and are a great affordable option for moving all distances. The security and coverage provided by cargo trailers make them an excellent choice for interstate moving. These trailers are also used to store and transport items like bikes or appliances that are hard to pack in a box truck. </p>
                  <h5>Portable containers</h5>
                  <p>Portable containers are large crates that are attached to specially designed-trucks. Companies providing this service drop the containers at your house, pick them up and store them and then transport them to the location on your move-in day. These containers are great for moving small to medium-sized homes.</p>
                  <p>If there's some time on your arrival date to your new house, portable containers are incredible for you! Not only do you get transportation services, but you also enjoy storage services with these containers. The only drawback is that these services are costly compared to the rest.</p>
                  <h4>Factors to Consider While Selecting a Trucking Service</h4>
                  <p>With hundreds of trucking companies available in the market, it can be challenging to figure out which one's right for you. Here is a list of things you should look for while choosing a trucking service:</p>
                  <h5>Reliability</h5>
                  <p>One of the most important things to look for in a trucking service is reliability. Make sure the service you're choosing has a proven track record of on-time and secured deliveries. You can ask previous customers and check online reviews to have an idea of how the reliability of that trucking service.</p>
                  <h5>Cost</h5>
                  <p>Cost is one of the deciding factors when selecting a trucking company and service. Make sure to get a quote from a trucking company and check if it suits your needs. Don't forget to ask if there are any additional payments or hidden fees. </p>
                  <h5>Services</h5>
                  <p>Different trucking companies provide various services. Make sure you know which service you want to get, and then check the trucking companies offering that service. Select the one you think caters to your needs.</p>
                  <h5>Equipment</h5>
                  <p>Trucking companies use various equipment, and not every one of them is suitable for each type of cargo. Therefore, inquire about the equipment the trucking company uses and evaluate if that is appropriate for your shipment.</p>
                  <h5>Location</h5>
                  <p>You want to make sure that the trucking company you're selecting operates in your location. It will be a perk if the trucking service is situated near your area, as it would make the delivery time shorter. </p>
